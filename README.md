# Welcome to Hellocopter

This project will allow me to develop my skills with vanilla JavaScript and the Canvas API. The result will be a functional sidescrolling helicopter game, rendered in 2D, featuring pixel art, collision detection, simple animations, intertia-like and gravity-like behavior, moving enemies, and victory/defeat logic. Reach goals include background parallax, dynamic enemies, and multiple canvases and levels. 

In Hellocopter, the player will assume the role of a helicopter pilot. The objective will be to rescue a capybara from hostile territory, avoiding projectiles from static defenses as well as enemy jets and helicopters. Most of the elements will be in the background, but some foreground elements, such as power lines and bridges, will damage the Hellocopter unless they are avoided in flight. The Hellocopter pilot must travel to a point on the opposite side of the map from the spawn location, land to pick up the capybara, and then traverse the map in the opposite direction, landing again at the spawn location. Successful traversal of the map will trigger a Victory screen.

## Functionality & MVPs


In Hellocopter, players will be able to:

-Traverse a premade map using keyboard controls \
-Experience physics-like behavior \
-Achieve objectives by maneuvering to specific locations\
-Enjoy pixel art brought to life by simple animations

### In addition, this project may include:

-Simple sound design and music\
-Multiple levels\
-Facts about capybaras

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
This project will use Canvas to render the game in a browser window, Javascript for the game logic, and Webpack to transpile the JS files. \

Implementation Timeline

Friday: familiarize with canvas, assemble assets\
Saturday: implemenet basic game canvas, player movement, collision detection\
Sunday: create sprite animations, build map, create win/loss logic\
Monday: create enemy logic, projectile behavior, projectile collisions\
Tuesday: polish, bug fixes, landing page styling\
Wednesday: flex-time, reach goals if project on pace\
Thursday Morning: upload, final test flight\
